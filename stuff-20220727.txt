I believe the passenger gem is not needed when integrating Passenger with either Apache or Nginx. If you add Passenger to your Gemfile, then "rails server" will launch Passenger instead of Puma. You can also choose to launch Passenger directly.
gem "passenger", ">= 5.3.2", require: "phusion_passenger/rack_handler"

cd /var/www/myapp
sudo -u myappuser -H git clone git://github.com/username/myapp.git code
/var/www/myapp/code

The site https://www.phusionpassenger.com/ suggests deploying the rails app to /var/www/myapp/code - a valid choice, and probably right for production (?), but I know it is not required for development.
cd /var/www/myapp
sudo -u myappuser -H git clone git://github.com/username/myapp.git code

/etc/apache2/sites-available/wire6.conf
# Tell Apache and Passenger where your app's 'public' directory is
DocumentRoot /home/fallstechdave/railsprojects/wire6/public
PassengerRuby /home/fallstechdave/.rbenv/versions/3.1.2/bin/ruby

Working remotely today on PEGA-220, will configure mod_auth_openidc to integrate with PingIdentity as the OIDC provider (previously successfully used Keycloak as provider).

I do not know the merits of using Passenger (vs Puma) during development (bin/rails server).

    Thereâ€™s ways to trick this in the system, depends if the hardening allows it

    Please capture this in a ticket and this can be something DevOps assists in setting up correctly

    Our current instructions suggest /var/www/myapp (I wasn't familiar with the /code part), but yesterday I did try pointing elsewhere. It hasn't worked yet (though I think for different reasons).
